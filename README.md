# README

### Brief
This is yet another toy language called Fung after one of its keywords called "fun". It will be a minimal, nil-strict language with a dynamic, strong typing system and clean syntax. This repo will also just be a spare time project and I have no plans of this trending in any way.

### TODO
 - Create grammar. (DONE)
 - Create lexer and token. (DONE)
 - Create all AST parts. (DONE)
 - Create parser. (WIP and TESTING)
 - Create VM and specify its instruction set.
 - Create VM code generator.

### Other Notes
 - Only building on *nix systems is supported.
 - The code is still a WIP and unstable.
